# macroproject_4sem

This is our final project for college course and we are going to simulate the formation of a snowflake.

To view the generated snapshots:
1) import crystal-step-_.vtu into ParaView
2) generate glyph
3) set "box" glyph type
4) set appropriate scale (e.g. 0.5)
5) set "state" as scale array if you want to view only frozen nodes.
6) set coloring array to view the destribution of concentration or tempurature

Finally it should look like this:
